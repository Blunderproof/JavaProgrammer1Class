# Java 8 Programmer 1 UtahRETC Class Content

We're using [OCA: Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8
Programmer](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118957407.html)
as a reference of the content that should covered in this class. Keep in mind
that the goal is that by the end of the class, students will be able to take
the Programmer I certificate test and pass.

### Slides

Slides are generated using [Marp](https://yhatt.github.io/marp/) which uses
markdown for its formatting. This will give us a consistant look and feel to
every slide deck, even when different people are working on different sections.
For an introduction to markdown, follow
[this](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) link. And for
examples of how Marp translates markdown formatting into slides, follow
[this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yhatt/marp/master/example.md) link for
an example slide deck.

### Getting started

Follow these steps to create a new slide deck:

1. Pick a section in the [outline documentation](classes/outline.md) and make
   sure you are familiar and confortable with the content.
2. Make a copy of the [sample outline](samples/sample_outline.md) and rename it
   to `class_N_outline.md` where `N` is your class number (obvs). Make sure to
   save this file in that same folder. This is where can put notes, questions,
   and homework information for your section. This will be useful for putting
   together the slides, running the class, and getting other instructors up to
   speed on that week's class so that they can help.
3. Make a copy of the [sample slides](samples/sample_slides.md) and rename it
   to `class_N_slides.md` in that same folder.
4. Using Marp, export your slide deck as a PDF and save it to the `slides`
   directory. (`File > Export Slides as PDF`)

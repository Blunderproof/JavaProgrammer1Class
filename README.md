# Study guide for Java 8 Programmer I

We're using [OCA: Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8
Programmer](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118957407.html)
as a reference of the content that should covered in this class. Keep in mind
that the goal is that by the end of the class, students will be able to take
the Programmer I certificate test and pass.

### Slides

Slides are generated using [Marp](https://yhatt.github.io/marp/) which uses
markdown for its formatting. This will give us a consistant look and feel to
every slide deck, even when different people are working on different sections.
For an introduction to markdown, follow
[this](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) link. And for
examples of how Marp translates markdown formatting into slides, follow
[this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yhatt/marp/master/example.md) link for
an example slide deck.

# Study guide for Java 8 Programmer I


### Slides

Slides are generated using [Marp](https://yhatt.github.io/marp/) which uses
markdown for its formatting. This will give us a consistant look and feel to
every slide deck, even when different people are working on different sections.
For an introduction to markdown, follow
[this](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) link. And for
examples of how Marp translates markdown formatting into slides, follow
[this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yhatt/marp/master/example.md) link for
an example slide deck.
